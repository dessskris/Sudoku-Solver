By inputting the mystery puzzle boards 'mystery1', 'mystery2', and
'mystery3' in the function solve_board, the following results may be
concluded:

- The board 'mystery1' has a solution. I have stored a copy of the
  solution in _________

- The board 'mystery2' has no solution. This is the board that's
  impossible to solve.

- The board 'mystery3' has a solution. I have stored a copy of the
  solution in _________

I am now left to identify which board is of "hard" difficulty and
which board is of "extremely hard" difficulty.


The difficulty level of a Sudoku board is a subjective manner. As to
 eliminate ambiguity, I would like to define several ways to distinguish the
 difficulty levels.

METHOD 1: The number of starting digits in the initial Sudoku board
- The 'easy' board has 26 starting digits
- The 'medium' board has 25 starting digits
- The 'mystery1' board has 23 starting digits
- The 'mystery3' board has 24 starting digits

CONCLUSION 1:
Sorting the boards by the number of starting digits from the most
digits to the fewest digits:
'easy', 'medium', 'mystery3', 'mystery1'
Since 'mystery3' has more starting digits than 'mystery1', it may be
deduced that 'mystery3' is of "hard" difficulty and 'mystery1' is of
"extremely hard" difficulty.

METHOD 2: The number of starting digits in each subgrid
- The 'easy' board has 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3 starting digits in
each respective subgrid
- The 'medium' board has 4, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4 starting digits in
each respective subgrid
- The 'mystery1' board has 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3 starting digits in
each respective subgrid
- The 'mystery3' board has 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 3 starting digits in
each respective subgrid

CONCLUSION 2:
- The 'easy' board has 1 subgrid with 2 starting digits
- The 'medium' board has 4 subgrids with 2 starting digits
- The 'mystery1' board has 5 subgrids with 2 starting digits
- The 'mystery3' board has 4 subgrids with 2 starting digits
Notice 'mystery3' has fewer subgrids with 2 starting digits than
'mystery1'; and 'mystery3' has 1 subgrid with 4 starting digits whereas
'mystery1' has no subgrids with 4 starting digits. Therefore it may be
deduced that 'mystery3' is of "hard" difficulty and 'mystery1' is of
'extremely hard' difficulty.

METHOD 3: The number of starting digits for each digit 1-9 in the
initial Sudoku board
- The 'easy' board has 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2 starting digits for
each digit 1-9 respectively
- The 'medium' board has 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2 starting digits for
each digit 1-9 respectively
- The 'mystery1' board has 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3 starting digits
for each digit 1-9 respectively
- The 'mystery3' board has 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4 starting digits
for each digit 1-9 respectively

CONCLUSION 3:
- The 'easy' board has 4 digits that appear as starting digits 2 times
- The 'medium' board has 5 digits that appear as starting digits 2 times
- The 'mystery1' board has 5 digits that appear as starting digits 2
times
- The 'mystery3' board has 4 digits that appear as starting digits 2
times
- The 'easy' board has 3 digits that appear as starting digits 3 times
- The 'medium' board has 2 digits that appear as starting digits 3 times
- The 'mystery1' board has 3 digits that appear as starting digits 3
times
- The 'mystery3' board has 1 digit that appear as starting digits 3
times
